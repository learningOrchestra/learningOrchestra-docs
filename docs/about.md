# About learningOrchestra

Nowadays, **data science relies on a wide range of computer science skills**, from data management to algorithm design, from code optimization to cloud infrastructures. Data scientists are expected to have expertise in these diverse fields, especially when working in small teams or for academia.

This situation can constitute a barrier to the actual extraction of new knowledge from collected data,
which is why the last two decades have seen more efforts to facilitate and streamline the development of
data mining workflows. The tools created can be sorted into two categories: **high-level** tools facilitate
the building of **automatic data processing pipelines** (e.g. [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/))
while **low-level** ones support the setup of appropriate physical and virtual infrastructure (e.g. [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)).

However, this landscape is still missing a tool that **encompasses all steps and needs of a typical data science project**. This is where learningOrchestra comes in.
