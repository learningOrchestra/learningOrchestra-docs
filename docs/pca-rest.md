# PCA API

PCA is used to decompose a multivariate dataset in a set of successive orthogonal components that explain a maximum amount of the variance.

In `scikit-learn` (used in this microservice), PCA is implemented as a transformer object that learns components in its fit method, and can be used on new data to project it on these components.

PCA centers but does not scale the input data for each feature before applying the SVD. The optional parameter `whiten = True` makes it possible to project the data onto the singular space while scaling each component to unit variance.

This is often useful if the models down-stream make strong assumptions on the isotropy of the signal: this is for example the case for Support Vector Machines with the RBF kernel and the K-Means clustering algorithm, more information about this algorithm in [scikit-learn PCA docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#pca).

## Create an image plot

`POST CLUSTER_IP:5006/images/<parent_filename>`

The request uses a `parent_filename` as a dataset filename, the body contains the json fields:

```json
{
    "pca_filename": "image_plot_filename",
    "label_name": "dataset_label_column"
}
```

The `label_name` is the label name column for machine learning datasets which has labeled tuples. In the case that the dataset used doesn't contain labeled tuples, define the value as null type in JSON:

```json
{
    "pca_filename": "image_plot_filename",
    "label_name": null
}
```

## Delete an image plot

`DELETE CLUSTER_IP:5006/images/<image_plot_filename>`

Deletes an image plot from the database.

## Read the filenames of the created images

`GET CLUSTER_IP:5006/images`

Returns a list with all created image plot filenames.

## Read an image plot

`GET CLUSTER_IP:5006/images/<image_plot_filename>`

Returns the image plot of `filename` specified.
